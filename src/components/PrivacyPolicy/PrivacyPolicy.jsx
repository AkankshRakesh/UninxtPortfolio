                This Online Privacy Statement only describes our Site practices. It does not apply to how we generally collect or use
                other information we collect from or about you as a customer or applicant for a student loan.
                In addition, our Sites may link to third-party services or apps that we don’t control, including social media sites
                (collectively “Third Party Sites”). You should be aware that Third Party Sites may have different privacy practices from
                our Site and may provide less security than this Site. The choice to access a Third-Party Site is yours, in your sole
                discretion.
                Please note that this Online Privacy Statement also applies regardless of how you may access the Site, including through
                a mobile device. Once you leave our Site or are redirected to a Third-Party Site, you are no longer governed by this
                Online Privacy Statement.
